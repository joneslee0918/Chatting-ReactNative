## Setup 

- first `git clone` the repository locally
- to run the Meteor app, `cd meteor-chat-mtr`, type `meteor`, and open Chrome to `localhost:3000`
- to establish a connection with a local Meteor server, you will have to open the file `MeteorChatRN/app/config/ddp.js` and change `line 8` to read from your computer's IP Address. You can find this out by typing `ifconfig` in your terminal. If running from a deployed Meteor server, you would instead use the full url of the site as instructed in the [`ddp-client`](https://github.com/hharnisc/node-ddp-client) repository's instructions
- to run the iOS app, from the root directory, `cd MeteorChatRN`, then type `ios/MeteorChatRN.xcodeproj` to open the project in XCode (you must have an up-to-date version of `XCode`), then hit the `play` icon to run the app in a simulator
- to run the Android app, first make sure the iOS Node server is not running (hit `stop` in XCode), then open an Android simulator (most users find [`Genymotion`](https://www.genymotion.com/) to be user-friendly and has a free tier). In your React-native root, type `react-native run-android` to run the app on the Android simulator

## Libraries used

#### For Meteor, the following packages were used - to add them to other projects just type `meteor add` + project name in your Meteor app
  - `checks` for server-side data checks
  - `react` for using React 
  - `react-template-helper` for including React components in Blaze templates
  - `iron:router` for routing
  - `accounts-password` for Meteor's easy-to-use user account management
  
#### For React Native, the following libraries were used - to add them to other projects in React Native just type `npm install ` + package + `--save`
  - [`react-native-navbar`](https://github.com/react-native-fellowship/react-native-navbar) for a reusable navbar on iOS and Android - note, to enable use on Android, you must comment out references in the library code to `TabBarIOS`; this is already done here - see the `index.js` file in the `node_modules/react-native-navbar` directory
  - [`react-native-invertible-scroll-view`](https://github.com/exponentjs/react-native-invertible-scroll-view) for easy to implement UI in situations where you want to focus the screen towards the bottom of the `ScrollView`; this is particularly useful for chat applications
  - [`ddp-client`](https://github.com/hharnisc/node-ddp-client) for establishing a DDP connection with the remote Meteor server and adding to collections server-side
  - [`react-native-vector-icons`](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) for using MaterialIcon fonts as well as other icon fonts; the installation of this package for iOS and Android is distinct, but can easily be implemented through the source project instructions
